    <p>(After which this site will be repurposed for something else)</p>
    <p>I realize that preventing you from talking about this likely made it harder for you to be able to process it, and that was never really my intention, I just didn't feel ready to take on the world. But that's changed now, and I hope that I can gift you some peace of mind as well as maybe giving you some new talking points as an excuse to engage the family in conversation. I've never been the best at vocalizing my feelings, but the support that you have given me has definitely made it a lot easier than it could have been, and I will be forever grateful for that. Thank you, and happy birthday.</p>
    <p>Love, Natalie</p>
